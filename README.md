Game rules for spaceship design and combat.

## Design Notes
These rules are an homage to _Starfire_.

I wrote these rules in one inspired evening as a teen. I had just read a detailed review of _Starfire_ (an actual, published game). I thought the system sounded great. But I was a broke teen. So, instead of rushing out to buy a copy of _Starfire_, I sat down at my desk and puzzled-out a system on my own. The result was several binder-paper sheets with rules and charts written out longhand.

Recently, I discovered those folded sheets in my garage. And decided to immortalize them here.

I never have had the opportunity to read the orginal source material. I did, however, read reviews of _Starfire_ on BBG. It sounds like my version is more variant than faithful re-creation. Still, I am happy with it.
